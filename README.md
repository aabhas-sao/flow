## Why flow

If you use Claude Code daily, you've felt the ceiling: every session
is a new hire. Brilliant, capable, ready to help — but with no memory
of yesterday's decisions, last week's migrations, or the half-finished
threads in your other tabs. You spend the first ten minutes of every
session catching it up.

flow changes the relationship. It's a complete task manager —
projects, tasks, structured briefs, progress notes, playbooks for
recurring work — *and* a working memory layer that injects all of it
into every Claude session automatically. Capture once, work with
Claude on it forever.

The first session feels normal. By session ten, Claude knows your
codebase quirks, your team, the customer you keep mentioning, and
the migration you're three steps into. By session fifty, it's the
engineer on your team — not a new hire you re-explain yourself to
every morning.

Built for power users who want Claude to *work with them*, not just
*help them*.

## How context compounds

Every task feeds the same knowledge base. Every closed task makes
the next one smarter.

                   flow do <task>             │ scoop    │ sweep
    ┌────────┐  ─────────────────▶  ┌─────────┴──────────┴─────┐
    │  Task  │                      │      Claude session      │
    │  brief │  ◀──── updates ───── │  loads brief + kb +      │
    │ +notes │                      │  notes + repo conventions│
    └────────┘  ─── flow done ───▶  └──────────────────────────┘
                                        (auto-sweep transcript
                                         into kb on done)
```

- **Scoop (live):** during a session the flow skill listens for
  durable facts you mention — your role, a teammate's name, a
  product convention — and appends them to the matching kb file
  on the fly.
- **Sweep (on `flow done`):** when you close a task, flow spawns
  a headless Claude pass that re-reads the entire transcript and
  pulls anything kb-worthy that the live scoop missed. The status
  flip is the contract; the sweep is best-effort.
- **Cross-reference:** `flow transcript <sibling-task>` lets a
  current session read what was decided in a related one — useful
  when the brief alone doesn't carry enough context.

Net effect: the longer you use flow, the more your knowledge base
grows, the less you re-explain yourself.

## Playbooks for the work you do on cadence

Some work repeats. Weekly reviews. Daily PR triage. On-call rotations.
Customer-meeting prep.

A **playbook** is a reusable run definition — a markdown brief that
describes what a run does. `flow run playbook weekly-review` snapshots
that brief into a fresh task and spawns a new Claude session against
it. Every run is reproducible (it executes against a frozen snapshot,
so editing the playbook later doesn't rewrite history) and contributes
back to the knowledge base on `flow done` like any other task.

```
┌──────────┐  flow run playbook weekly-review
│ Playbook │ ────────▶ snapshot ─────▶ new task ─────▶ new session
│  brief   │           (frozen for                     (executes
└──────────┘            reproducibility)                against snapshot)
```

Same compounding mechanic — your weekly review session two months from
now will know everything every prior weekly review surfaced.

## Installation

### Homebrew (Recommended for macOS)

```bash
brew install --cask Facets-cloud/tap/flow
flow init
```

### Quick Install (macOS & Linux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Facets-cloud/flow/main/install.sh | bash
flow init
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **macOS Users**: Since the binary is currently unsigned, macOS will "quarantine" it. The install script automatically tries to remove this flag, but if you see a "Developer cannot be verified" error, run:
> `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine $(which flow)`

### Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
iwr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Facets-cloud/flow/main/install.ps1 | iex
flow init
```

### via Claude Code

In any Claude Code session, paste this:

> Install flow from https://github.com/Facets-cloud/flow

Claude reads the repo, downloads the binary, and runs `flow init` —
which installs the flow skill into `~/.claude/skills/flow/SKILL.md`
and registers a SessionStart hook so every future Claude session
loads the skill automatically. Then say **"let's get to work"** and
follow along.

`flow init` is the step that wires flow into Claude Code. It:

- Creates `~/.flow/` (database, kb, projects, tasks, playbooks)
- Writes the flow skill to `~/.claude/skills/flow/SKILL.md`
- Adds a SessionStart hook to `~/.claude/settings.json` so every new
  Claude Code session auto-loads the skill

## Upgrade

In any Claude Code session:

> Upgrade flow from https://github.com/Facets-cloud/flow

Claude fetches the latest release binary and runs `flow skill
update` to refresh the skill and re-wire the SessionStart and
UserPromptSubmit hooks. Check the running version with
`flow --version`.

## Quickstart

Just open Claude and say **"let's get to work"**. The skill
handles the rest.

## What you get

- **One task, one Claude session, one tab.** `flow do <task>`
  spawns a dedicated tab in iTerm2 or stock macOS Terminal — flow
  picks whichever you launched it from. Tomorrow's `flow do <task>`
  resumes the same conversation.
- **Interview-driven task capture.** No forms. flow asks
  what / why / where / done-when, then writes a structured brief.
- **A knowledge base that grows.** Five markdown buckets for
  durable facts about you, your team, products, processes, and
  customers. Live-appended during sessions; auto-swept from
  transcripts on `flow done`.
- **Per-task progress notes.** Append-only logs. Pick up where
  you left off, even after a week away.
- **Playbooks for cadence work.** Weekly reviews, daily triage,
  on-call rotations — define once, run on demand.
- **A Claude skill that speaks plain English.** "What should I
  work on", "resume auth", "save a note" — the skill turns intent
  into flow commands.

## How it works under the hood

`flow do <task>` pre-allocates a session UUID, writes it to the
task row, and spawns a tab in iTerm2 or stock Terminal.app (chosen
by `TERM_PROGRAM`, falls back to iTerm) running
`claude --session-id <uuid>` with `FLOW_TASK` / `FLOW_PROJECT`
inlined. The jsonl file lands at the deterministic path
`~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<uuid>.jsonl`, so future
`flow do` calls run `claude --resume <uuid>` to continue the same
conversation. A SessionStart hook re-injects the task brief,
updates, and CLAUDE.md context on every resume; a UserPromptSubmit
hook keeps the flow skill discoverable in ad-hoc Claude sessions.

The first `flow do` from stock Terminal.app needs macOS Accessibility
permission for the **app hosting your shell** — not the `flow` binary
itself. Terminal.app's AppleScript dictionary has no "make new tab"
verb, so flow drives cmd-T through System Events, and System Events
checks Accessibility against the responsible parent app. Until that's
granted, `flow do` errors out with a multi-line explanation pointing at
System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility (enable the
toggle for "Terminal" if you launched flow from Terminal.app, "iTerm"
from iTerm2, "Claude" if Claude Code is the host, etc.; add it via the
+ button if it's not listed). After the grant the spawn is silent.
iTerm2 doesn't need this — it has a native `create tab` verb.

## Your data — local, portable, yours

Everything flow stores lives under `~/.flow/` (override with
`$FLOW_ROOT`). No server, no cloud, no telemetry. Plain markdown
beside a SQLite index — readable in any editor, versionable in git.

```
~/.flow/
  flow.db                          # SQLite — projects, tasks, playbooks index
  kb/
    user.md  org.md  products.md
    processes.md  business.md      # 5 markdown buckets, append-only
  projects/<slug>/
    brief.md
    updates/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md
  tasks/<slug>/
    brief.md
    updates/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md
  playbooks/<slug>/
    brief.md
    updates/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md
```

The SQLite database is an *index*, not the source of truth — every
task and project has its real content in the markdown files next to
it. You could delete `flow.db` and rebuild it from the markdown if
you had to.

### Backup & sync

Pick whichever fits your workflow:

- **Git (recommended for single-user history).**
  ```bash
  cd ~/.flow && git init && git add . && git commit -m "initial"
  ```
  Commit periodically. The SQLite file is binary, so diffs aren't
  useful, but each commit is a clean snapshot. **If you push to a
  shared remote**, add `kb/` to `.gitignore` first — kb files often
  contain personal or org-sensitive notes you don't want public.

- **Time Machine / system backup.** Just works, no setup.

- **iCloud Drive / Dropbox / Google Drive.** Symlink `~/.flow` into
  the synced folder:
  ```bash
  mv ~/.flow ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/flow
  ln -s ~/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/flow ~/.flow
  ```
  ⚠️ **Don't run flow on two machines simultaneously** through a
  synced folder — SQLite doesn't tolerate concurrent writes from
  separate hosts and you can corrupt `flow.db`. Use this for backup
  + occasional second-machine access, not active multi-machine use.

- **Manual rsync.** `rsync -a ~/.flow/ /path/to/backup/flow/` on a
  schedule. Same caveat about concurrent writes.

To move flow to a new machine: copy `~/.flow/` over, install the
binary, and run `flow init` once — it'll pick up the existing data
and reinstall the skill + hook.

## Where flow runs (and where we'd love help)

Today flow runs on **macOS (iTerm2 or stock Terminal.app) + Claude
Code only**. That's the stack we use, and that's what the
session-spawn layer was built and tested against.

The architecture is portable — session spawning is one small
package — but other harnesses (Codex, Cursor, plain shell) and other
terminals (Linux + tmux/zellij/wezterm, Windows Terminal) need
contributors who run those stacks daily and care enough to wire them
in. If that's you, [a PR is very welcome](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Where flow came from

flow started as an internal tool at Facets. We use Claude Code every
day, and the context-loss problem was eating into how much of the
tool's capability we could actually use. flow fixed that for us — to
the point where we couldn't imagine working without it. We're
open-sourcing it as-is because it might do the same for you.

This is not a Facets product. There's no signup, no cloud, no upsell.
Just the tool we built for ourselves.
